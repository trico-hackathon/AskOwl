## Project Description

AskOwl is a chatbot that provides quick and accurate info, making more pleasant the experience of navigating the oftentimes inaccessible school websites. 

## Prototype Summary

Prototype: A web app with a front end that allows users to inquire about the next available blue bus given a desired time to leave and the target destination. Currently, bus schedules from Mon to Thurs are available for inquiry. Text-to-speech features are also enabled for visually impaired users. 

### Instructions for Running the Code
`npm i` to install the dependencies  
`npm run dev-js` for testing & development

## Next Steps

Future Work: 

1. Add more info (weekend bus schedules, menu, etc.).

2. Conduct user input analysis with NLP to allow users to enter text prompts instead of pressing buttons.

3. Interactive user interface by connecting to ChatGPT API.

4. Expand to Tri-Co Info (or beyond!).
